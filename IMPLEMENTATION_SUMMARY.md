# Farm Manager 4U Backend - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Based on the data dictionary provided, I have successfully implemented all the necessary database functions and handlers for the Farm Manager 4U backend system.

## Entities Implemented

### 1. Crop Entity (`data/crop.go`)
- **Attributes**: cropId, farmId, name, plantingDate, harvestDate, quantity, status, notes
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one Farm (Many-to-One)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Additional Queries**: Get by farm, get by status

### 2. Livestock Entity (`data/livestock.go`)
- **Attributes**: livestockId, farmId, type, count, acquisitionDate, healthStatus, notes
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one Farm (Many-to-One)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Additional Queries**: Get by farm, get by type, get by health status

### 3. Employee Entity (`data/employee.go`)
- **Attributes**: employeeId, userId, farmId, firstName, lastName, position, salary, hireDate, contactInfo
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one Farm (Many-to-One), optionally linked to one User (Many-to-One)
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Additional Queries**: Get by farm, get by user, get by position, get by status

## API Endpoints Created

### Crop Endpoints (`/api/crops`)
- `POST /` - Create crop (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /` - Get crops by farm (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /{id}` - Get single crop by ID
- `PUT /{id}` - Update crop by ID
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete crop by ID

### Livestock Endpoints (`/api/livestock`)
- `POST /` - Create livestock (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /` - Get livestock by farm (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /{id}` - Get single livestock by ID
- `PUT /{id}` - Update livestock by ID
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete livestock by ID

### Employee Endpoints (`/api/employees`)
- `POST /` - Create employee (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /` - Get employees by farm (requires farmId query parameter)
- `GET /{id}` - Get single employee by ID
- `PUT /{id}` - Update employee by ID
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete employee by ID

## Security Features
- All endpoints are protected with JWT middleware
- User authentication required for all operations
- Farm ownership verification for all farm-related operations
- Access control ensures users can only access their own farms and related data

## Database Features
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Soft delete functionality using GORM's DeletedAt
- Automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Foreign key relationships properly defined
- GORM tags for proper database mapping

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `data/crop.go` - Crop model and repository
2. `data/livestock.go` - Livestock model and repository
3. `data/employee.go` - Employee model and repository
4. `cmd/api/crop.go` - Crop HTTP handlers
5. `cmd/api/livestock.go` - Livestock HTTP handlers
6. `cmd/api/employee.go` - Employee HTTP handlers

### Modified Files:
1. `data/models.go` - Updated to include new interfaces
2. `cmd/api/routes.go` - Added new API routes

## Data Dictionary Compliance
All entities have been implemented according to the specifications in the data dictionary:
- ✅ Farm entity (already existed)
- ✅ Crop entity (newly implemented)
- ✅ Livestock entity (newly implemented)
- ✅ Employee entity (newly implemented)
- ✅ User entity (already existed)

## Next Steps
1. Run database migrations to create the new tables
2. Test the API endpoints
3. Add any additional validation or business logic as needed
4. Consider adding pagination for list endpoints
5. Add search/filtering capabilities if required

## Usage Examples

### Create a Crop
```bash
POST /api/crops?farmId=<farm-uuid>
{
  "name": "Tomatoes",
  "plantingDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "harvestDate": "2024-04-15T00:00:00Z",
  "quantity": 100,
  "status": "Growing",
  "notes": "Planted in greenhouse"
}
```

### Create Livestock
```bash
POST /api/livestock?farmId=<farm-uuid>
{
  "type": "Cattle",
  "count": 25,
  "acquisitionDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "healthStatus": "Healthy",
  "notes": "Angus cattle for beef production"
}
```

### Create Employee
```bash
POST /api/employees?farmId=<farm-uuid>
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "position": "Farm Manager",
  "salary": 50000,
  "hireDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "contactInfo": "john.doe@email.com",
  "status": "Active"
}
```

All endpoints require proper JWT authentication and will validate farm ownership before allowing operations.
